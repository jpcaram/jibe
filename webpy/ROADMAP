* The main app should be a container widget.
  That way we can add/remove children dynamically. Otherwise there is
  no way to add/remove.

  To test, have a button that when clicked, adds labels.

* Preserve state of a widget when removed and then added again.
  E.g. The value of an input. The style?

* Multiple Apps, Multiple Users, Sessions

* Authentication

Small tasks:

* Add label widget. -- DONE --
* Separate MainApp from example/derived Apps. -- DONE --
  - Now it is a descendent of VBox.
* Set attributes and style. -- DONE --
  - Styles done.
* Image widget (w/ Matplotlib?) -- DONE --
* App assets.
* Progress bar widget
* Container widgets to receive children in constructor parameters.


Issues:

* If MainApp does not have widgets? Common mistake.
