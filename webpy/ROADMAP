* The main app should be a container widget.
  That way we can add/remove children dynamically. Otherwise there is
  no way to add/remove.

  To test, have a button that when clicked, adds labels.

* Preserve state of a widget when removed and then added again.
  E.g. The value of an input. The style?

* Multiple Apps, Multiple Users, Sessions

Small tasks:

* Add label widget.
* Separate MainApp from example/derived Apps.
* Set attributes and style
