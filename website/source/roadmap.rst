Roadmap
=======

Jibe is at the very beginning of its development, so
expect changes to the behavior and the API at any time.

If you need to rely on a specific behavior and API
right now, your only option is to use a specific
version of Jibe and not update.

To use a specific release use **pip**. For example::

    pip install jibe==0.1.3

To use a specific commit from the git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/jpcaram/jibe.git
    cd jibe
    git checkout 6025070c48b39cae190aa9fbe4f990e62cb5ed9b

The entire commit history is `here <https://github.com/jpcaram/jibe/commits/master>`_.
